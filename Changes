Revision history for Perl extension User::Identity.

version 0.05: Mon Jul 28 18:34:49 CEST 2003

	Interface breaking:

	- Mail::Identity::email() renamed to Mail::Identity::address(),
	  otherwise some very confusion options would appear.

	- Mail::Identity::domainname() renamed to Mail::Identity::domain(),
	  which feels better.

	- Mail::Identity::address() defaults to Mail::Identity::name()
	  if no username or domainname are present.

	Fixes:

	Improvements:

	- Added charset to Mail::Identity

	- Moved all modules to the lib sub-directory, which makes the
	  */Makefile.PL helpers redundant.

	- Added Mail::Identity->from(Mail::Address or User::Identity)

	- Added enough options to OODoc::processFiles() to be able
	  to join multiple distributions into one set of documentation
	  pages.

version 0.04: Tue Mar 25 08:19:13 CET 2003

	Fixes:

	- [Jorg Krieger] found typo's and saw that the ::System module
	  was not correctly produced via copy-paste: too many things
	  refered to e-mail i.s.o. systems.
